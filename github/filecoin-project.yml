  # Admin permissions map to "org owner" permissions listed in 
  # https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization#permissions-for-organization-rolesare 
  # These permissions are very broad, and thus, the list of people is intentionally minimal.
  # Day-to-day administrating is done by those in the "github-mgmt Stewards" team (see team below).  
  # "github-mgmt Stewards" team can still escalate into org owner permissions if/when needed.  
  # This minimal owner set plus supporting rationale was documented and discussed in https://github.com/filecoin-project/github-mgmt/issues/47.

    # Why @anorth?
    # 1. Long-time Filecoin developer and filecoin-project GitHub owner
    # 2. Currently an independent contractor, not exclusively homed under one team.
    - anorth
    # Why @BigLep?
    # He was originally given temporary org ownership to complete https://github.com/filecoin-project/github-mgmt/issues/47 via:
    # 1. Accessing the (audit log)[https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/reviewing-the-audit-log-for-your-organization]
    #    so I can be sure I'm not advocating for removing owner ownership of someone who has been very active on administering the org
    # 2. Giving the "github-mgmt Stewards" team [moderator](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization#organization-moderators) 
    #    and [security manager](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization#security-managers) roles.
    # His ownership is being extended beyond https://github.com/filecoin-project/github-mgmt/issues/47 at least through 2024-12-31 because he:
    # 1. Has been leading the effort to improve the operational posture of the filecoin-project org
    # 2. Is experienced adminstering other similar orgs (e.g., ipfs)
    # 3. Is an independent contractor (similar to @anorth)
    - BigLep
    # Why @galargh?
    # 1. co-founder of [IPDX](https://ipdx.co) and IPDX is contracted to help look after GitHub for this organization at least through 2024.
    # 2. Multiple years of experience managing GitHub organizations of open source projects, including this org and related orgs like ipfs.
    - galargh
    # Why @jennijuju?
    # 1. Has a long history with filecoin-project and has a lot of connections to teams across filecoin-project.  
    #    She often has history or context on projects and can anticipate needs or issues that may arise.
    # 2. She has repeatedly demonstrated promptness to notice and engage in operational/security events, 
    #    where having the ability to "break class" without barriers (like an "org owner" is able) is most warranted.
    - jennijuju
    # Why @magik6k?
    # 1. He represents another portion of the Filecoin ecystem: Curio
    # 2. Long-time / OG Filecoin developer with broader awareness and GitHub operational experience
    - magik6k
    # Why @mastrwayne-admin?
    # 1. Founder/leader of [sead](https://www.sead.ai/), which is charged with sysadmin for critical systems within the wider Protocol Labs Network.
    # 2. general long-standing sysadmin for these organizations with his past roles at PL Inc.
    # 3. This isn't mastrwayne's day-to-day GitHub account

  github-mgmt approvers:
    # Notes: 
    # 1. These members have triage access to the github-mgmt repository.
    # 2. These members + github-mgmt-stewards + org owners are who can approve PRs to this repo.
    # 3. These members can't merge PRs.  They need a github-mgmt-stewards or org owner to do this.
    # 4. Having a team instead of direct collaborators on the github-mgmt repository also enables easy reference in the github-mgmt CODEOWNERS file.
    # 5. Leaning on "github-mgmt approvers" for day-to-day admin over true org owners was done
    #    as part of the effort to reduce org owners in https://github.com/filecoin-project/github-mgmt/issues/47

        # Why @rjan90?

        # 2. Experienced with GitHub operationally
        - rjan90
        # Why @Stebalien?
        # 1. Long-time Filecoin developer with broad awareness and GitHub operational experience. 
        # 2. He has experience working with github-mgmt in other contexts (e.g., ipfs, libp2p, ipld)
        - Stebalien

  github-mgmt stewards:
    # Notes: 
    # 1. These members have push+ access to the github-mgmt repository (in addition to the org owners listed in "members.admin" above).
    # 2. Having a team instead of direct collaborators on the github-mgmt repository also enables easy reference in the github-mgmt CODEOWNERS file.
    # 3. Leaning on "github-mgmt stewards" for day-to-day admin over true org owners was done
    #    as part of the effort to reduce org owners in https://github.com/filecoin-project/github-mgmt/issues/47 
    members:
      # WARN: membership here should be treated as cautiously as having an "org owner" role,
      # since one can escalate their privileges accordingly.
      # ATTN: members are expected to:
      #  - be familiar with github-mgmt / github-as-code
      #  - be ready to triage/review org configuration change requests in github-mgmt
      # INFO: There are others who could certainly qualify to be members of this team.  
      # There is a balance to be had to ensure there are enough knowledgeable people available to support the needs/requests of the github org,
      # and reducing risk by not having too many with the escalation path that this role affords.
      # INFO: Intentionally minimize "maintainers" so that additional membership is done through github-mgmt rather than the GitHub UI.
      # INFO: The individuals below are listed as "maintainers" rather than "members" because they are filecoin-project owners/admins (see "org.admin" above).
      # GitHub will auto-bump their team privileges anyway if we don't manually.
      maintainer:
        # Why @BigLep?
        # 1. This can be temporarily, but at least of 2024-08-02, he is contracted with FilOz to get github-mgmt setup and operationalized
        #    (e.g., https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/discussions/710).
        # 2. He has experience working with github-mgmt in other contexts (e.g., ipfs per https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs/issues/511)
        - BigLep
        # Why @galargh?
        # 1. Same reasons listed at the top in "members.admin".
        # 2. He has deep knowledge of the tool and its use as the creator.  This empowers him to help make changes and improvements in a low friction way.
        - galargh
        # Why @jennijuju?
        # 1. Same reasons listed at the top in "members.admin".
        # 2. She is part of the team rather than just relying on "org.admin" abilities so she sees the @filecoin-project/github-mgmt-stewards team mentions/notifications.
        - jennijuju
      member:
        # Whey @rvagg?
        # 1. He is an active in-the-GitHub-trenches maintainer for FilOz, often touching the 10+ repos that FilOz owns/maintains.
        #    FilOz wants to ensure changes to these repos is done under code review and transparently,
        #    and @rvagg is one of the key people who will be reviewing these changes.
        #    (FilOz is also guinea-pigging this process, but the hope/intent is to have other groups manage their repos in this way too if its successful.
        #    We are also dependent on some tooling improvement to support a diverse set of stakeholders that have limited blast radius.
        #    See https://github.com/ipdxco/github-as-code/issues/126 for more info.)
        # 2. He has experience working with github-mgmt in other contexts (e.g., ipld)
        - rvagg
        # Why @smagdali?
        # 1. Serves as technical projects representative for the Filecoin Foundation.
