# GitHub Management via Terraform

## What is it?
This repository is responsible for managing GitHub configuration of `filecoin-project` organisation as code with Terraform. It was created from [github-mgmt-template](https://github.com/protocol/github-mgmt-template) and it will receive updates from that repository.

**IMPORTANT**: Having write access to GitHub Management repository can be as powerful as having admin access to the organizations managed by that repository.

*NOTE*: Because we don't have merge queue functionality enabled for the repository yet, after a merge, wait for the `Apply` and `Update` workflows to complete before merging any other PRs.

## Tips / FYIs
* [github/filecoin-project.yml](https://github.com/filecoin-project/github-mgmt/blob/master/github/filecoin-project.yml) is the key file where updates are made to adjust permissions.
* "github-mgmt" was the old name.  The original template repo is now called "github-as-code".  We use the terms interchangably in comments/docs. 
* Yes, it's confusing to have a `.github` and `github` directory.  That is how gitub-mgmt was originally setup an we're living with it.  (At least of 2024-09-05, there is [no backlog item for cleaning this up](https://github.com/ipdxco/github-as-code/issues?page=1&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen).)
* Not all [organization-level roles](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization) are assignable through github-mgmt.  For example, organization moderators, billing managers, and ecurity managers need to set through the GitHub UI.
* github-mgmt calls [GitHub organization owners](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization#organization-owners) as "admins" in [filecoin-project.yml](https://github.com/filecoin-project/github-mgmt/blob/master/github/filecoin-project.yml).  These terms are used interchangably in comments/docs.
* At least as of 202409, AWS resources that terraform uses behind the scenes (e.g., S3 bucket, DDB table) are all stored in an ipdx.co-managed AWS account.  

## Organization Owner SOPs
Below is documentation/expecations [filecoin-project owners](https://github.com/orgs/filecoin-project/people?query=role%3Aowner).

### General
1. Have 2FA enabled on GitHub account
2. Be part of #filecoin-project-owners FIL Slack private channel

### Handling App Installation Requests
1. Per [docs](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/using-github-apps/requesting-a-github-app-from-your-organization-owner), org owners have to approve these requests.
2. Pending insallations can be reviewed at https://github.com/organizations/filecoin-project/settings/installations
   * New installation requests also come in via GitHub notificaitons to owners.   
3. Before approving the installation, ensure you have connected directly with the requester to understand their usecase and to ensure we're scoping down app access as much possible.  For example, it's better if an app only need access to specific repos than to the whole organization, especially if the app is created by a 3rd party and/or needs write permissions.
4. After approving, create a "log" of the approval by writing a message in #filecoin-project-owners following this template:

> **📝 App installation log entry**  
> What: what_is_being_requested  
> Requester: who_is_requesting  
> Reason: why_the_request_is_being_made  
> Approver: who_the_approver_is  
> App Installation Link: https://github.com/organizations/filecoin-project/settings/installations/######  

### Removing Members From the Organization
Removing members from the organization with github-mgmt has been disabled (see [here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/github-mgmt/blob/master/terraform/resources.tf)).  This is a security measure; org member removals are hard to revert because to re-invite someone, they have to accept the invitation. 

To remove someone, we follow these steps:
1. (anyone) Open a PR that removes the member from all teams and repositories and leaves a comment next to their name saying they'll be manually removed via the UI.  We do this so there is record in the commit history of the intent of the change.
2. Get the PR approved per normal process.
3. (github-mgmt-steward) Merge the PR.
4. (org owner) Confrim in https://github.com/filecoin-project/github-mgmt/actions that the actions are applied.
5. (org owner) Access the user in the GitHub UI at https://github.com/orgs/filecoin-project/people/USERNAME
6. (org owner) Remove the user from the organization via the "Remove from organization" button.
7. (org owner) Grab a screenshot
8. (org owner) [Run the sync workflow](https://github.com/filecoin-project/github-mgmt/actions/workflows/sync.yml) to remove the user from the terraform state
9. (org owner) Post back in the original PR that the user has been fully removed, including the screenshot and a link to the sync workflow run.

https://github.com/filecoin-project/github-mgmt/pull/66 is an example of this process.
